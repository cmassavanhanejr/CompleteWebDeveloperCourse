		<h3>How to win</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Checkmate: </strong> The player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check.</li>
			<li><strong>Resignation: </strong> Either player may resign, conceding the game to the opponent.</li>
			<li><strong>Win on time: </strong>In games with a time control, a player wins if the opponent runs out of time, even if the opponent has a superior position, as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent.</li>
			<li><strong>Forfeit: </strong> A player who cheats, violates the rules, or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament, can be forfeited.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3> What can we learn?</h3>
		<p>The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement; several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired and strengthened by it, so as to become habits ready on all occasions; for life is a kind of Chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effect of prudence, or the want of it. By playing at Chess then, we may learn:</p>
		<ol type="I">
			<li><strong>Foresight</strong>, which looks a little into futurity, and considers the consequences that may attend an action [...]</li>
			<li><strong>Circumspection</strong>, which surveys the whole Chess-board, or scene of action: – the relation of the several Pieces, and their situations [...]</li>
			<li><strong> Caution</strong>, not to make our moves too hastily [...]</li>
		</ol>
